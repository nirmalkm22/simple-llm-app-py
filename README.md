Project to have a simple LLM like chatgpt application

To integrate LLM with python

pip install openai\
pip install langchain\
pip install streamlit

To run the application:
streamlit run app.py

 Streamlit starts a local web server on your machine, typically accessible at `http://localhost:8501` by default.

 Your web browser automatically opens (or you can manually navigate) to the URL provided by Streamlit (usually http://localhost:8501), where you can interact with your LLM app
